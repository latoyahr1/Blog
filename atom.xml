    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WEEK 8!</p>

<p>Week 8 has definitely been the busiest week for me. I have so much work to do, and honestly half of it is late work but its getting done and im almost where I need to be. I'v been working on CSS, JQuery, Javascript, my portfolio, and some networking fundamentals. It&rsquo;s a lot of work but it has to be done. I&rsquo;m excited to learn more and can&rsquo;t wait to start the up and comming projects.</p>

<p>Who ever was responsible for the trip to Zendesk I want to thank you so much for that opportunity. Everything about the people and the place was just amazing. Even if I never see that place again, I will never forget that experience or the staff.</p>

<p>A special thanks to Jillian, me and my classmates thought she did a wonderful job.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 7 Blog! This week has definitely been a challenge for me. There&rsquo;s a lot of things thats due , and a lot to be done. I&rsquo;m currently working on code school, my portfolio-css skeleton, java-script and at the same time thinking about what i&rsquo;m going to blog about. I feel like i&rsquo;m all over the place doing so much but i&rsquo;m barley completing anything. I wish I could find a place with more space in my head so that when i&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s clear. So not only will I be able to complete my work but get organized and turn my assignments in on time. My report card is not ok, although it&rsquo;s a reflection of me, I soon will be where I need to be in order to complete this program.</p>
